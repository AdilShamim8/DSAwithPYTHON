## Data Structures  

### Stack  

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. You can find the implementation in `data_structures/stack.py`.  

### Queue  

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. You can find the implementation in `data_structures/queue.py`.  

### Linked List  

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one. You can find the implementation in `data_structures/linked_list.py`.  

## Algorithms  

### Sorting Algorithms  

1. **Bubble Sort**: An implementation of Bubble Sort can be found in `algorithms/sorting/bubble_sort.py`.  
2. **Quick Sort**: An implementation of Quick Sort can be found in `algorithms/sorting/quick_sort.py`.  

### Searching Algorithms  

1. **Binary Search**: An implementation of Binary Search can be found in `algorithms/searching/binary_search.py`.  
2. **Linear Search**: An implementation of Linear Search can be found in `algorithms/searching/linear_search.py`.
